This is one of my first web projects, inspired but not directly made for the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch). This project served me as mean to practice html, css and javascript. It intentionally avoids making use of the [html canvas element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas).

This web app makes use of Bresenham's Line Algorithm, has save and load features as a custom json files, customizable brush color and size, undo functionality and more.
